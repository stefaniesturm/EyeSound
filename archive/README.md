# EyeSound
Scripts for the EyeSound experiment
- EyeSound.mat contains information for subjects, trials, sounds, etc.
- EyeSound_Active.m is the script for active acquisition and test trials
- test_trials.m is a script I made originally for test trials only, which can be used as a backup, but is not needed for the experiment
- sounds.zip contains the sound files needed for the experiments
